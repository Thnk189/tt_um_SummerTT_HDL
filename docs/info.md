# Noise Pattern Generator 
## How it works
By using a LSFR (linear feedback shift register) and State Machine these will control an input to create a psuedo random noise based on a 8-bit sequence every single clock tick using clk. 

## How to test

havnt gotten that far

## External hardware

a  [Tiny Tapeout Audio Pmod](https://github.com/MichaelBell/tt-audio-pmod). possibly a button or switch, will see.
